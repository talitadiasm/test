# Use of Technology for Neurodevelopmental Diseases

## Introduction

Neurodevelopmental diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intellectual disabilities, affect millions of individuals worldwide. These conditions impact cognitive, social, and emotional development, often requiring lifelong support. Technology has emerged as a powerful tool to assist in diagnosis, intervention, education, and daily living for individuals with neurodevelopmental diseases.

## Examples of Technology Applications

- **Assistive Communication Devices:** Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices help non-verbal individuals communicate using symbols, text, or speech-generating technology.
- **Mobile Apps:** Apps for behavior tracking, social skills training, and cognitive exercises support therapy and learning outside clinical settings.
- **Wearable Devices:** Smartwatches and sensors monitor physiological signals, track activity, and provide real-time feedback to caregivers and clinicians.
- **Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR):** Immersive environments are used for social skills training, exposure therapy, and motor skills development.
- **Telehealth Platforms:** Remote assessment and therapy sessions increase access to specialists, especially in underserved areas.
- **Robotics:** Social robots engage children in interactive learning and therapy, improving motivation and participation.

## Benefits

- **Personalized Interventions:** Technology enables tailored approaches based on individual needs and progress.
- **Increased Accessibility:** Remote and digital tools reduce barriers to care and education.
- **Enhanced Engagement:** Interactive and gamified platforms improve motivation and adherence to interventions.
- **Data Collection:** Continuous monitoring provides valuable data for clinicians and researchers.

## Challenges

- **Accessibility and Cost:** Not all families or institutions can afford advanced technologies.
- **Privacy and Security:** Sensitive health and behavioral data must be protected.
- **Usability:** Devices and apps must be user-friendly for individuals with varying abilities.
- **Evidence Base:** More research is needed to validate the effectiveness of many technological interventions.
